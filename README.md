## About Me

Hello! I'm Samson Loftin, I'm an animator who transitioned into front-end web development because I wanted to learn new ways to create positive experiences. Whether it be simplifying an app to cause less frustration for the end-user, building a game that makes someone smile, or creating an app that focuses on creating a positive impact. I enjoy working on projects which bring joy & positivity to others.
